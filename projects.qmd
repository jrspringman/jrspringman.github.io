The [Machine Learning for Peace (MLP)](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/) project provides digital tools to help donors and civil society by monitoring and anticipating major political events and influence from geopolitical competitors and a flexible research infrastructure for policy research. MLP uses recent advances in big data and machine learning to provide actionable data at an unprecedented scale and frequency across more than 60 countries. MLP builds continuously on a repository of more than 120 million news articles capturing more than 12 years of daily coverage from a curated sample of more than 350 online newspapers publishing in more than 37 languages.

Applying cutting edge tools, MLP identifies the events and locations being reported in each article and uses predictive analytics to detect historical patterns and forecast likely changes in political conditions and foreign influence up to six months into the future. MLP's digital tools provide access to monthly data tracking 20 events bearing on civic space, including censorship, corruption, and legal changes, and 22 events indicative of foreign influence by geopolitical competitors, ranging from security engagements to domestic interference. Importantly, these data are updated every 90 days, ensuring their timeliness for analyzinging current events in addition to longer-term trends. 

### Central American Regional Media Project (ReMedios)

Under the ReMedios activity, DevLab is designing and implementing an evaluation of USAID programming meant to strengthen the capacity and security of journalists and media outlets working on issues related to corruption and government transparency. This project will involve a three-wave panel survey of journalists across five countries in Central America, scraping and machine classification of online news, and training a large language model to identify markers of quality in corruption reporting.
