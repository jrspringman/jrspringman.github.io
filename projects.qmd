### Machine Learning for Peace

::: {.grid  }
::: {.g-col-8}
The [Machine Learning for Peace (MLP)](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/) project provides digital tools to help donors and civil society by monitoring and anticipating major political events and influence from geopolitical competitors and a flexible research infrastructure for policy research. MLP uses recent advances in big data and machine learning to provide actionable data at an unprecedented scale and frequency across more than 60 countries. MLP builds continuously on a repository of more than 120 million news articles capturing more than 12 years of daily coverage from a curated sample of more than 350 online newspapers publishing in more than 37 languages.

Applying cutting edge tools, MLP identifies the events and locations being reported in each article and uses predictive analytics to detect historical patterns and forecast likely changes in political conditions and foreign influence up to six months into the future. MLP's digital tools provide access to monthly data tracking 20 events bearing on civic space, including censorship, corruption, and legal changes, and 22 events indicative of foreign influence by geopolitical competitors, ranging from security engagements to domestic interference. Importantly, these data are updated every 90 days, ensuring their timeliness for analyzinging current events in addition to longer-term trends. 

### Central American Regional Media Project (ReMedios)

Under the ReMedios activity, DevLab is designing and implementing an evaluation of USAID programming meant to strengthen the capacity and security of journalists and media outlets working on issues related to corruption and government transparency. This project will involve a three-wave panel survey of journalists across four countries in Central America, scraping and machine classification of online news, and training a large language model to identify markers of quality in corruption reporting. See the [Design Report](files/LER III S3-01 ReMedios ROPE Design Report_REDACTED.pdf) for more details.

### Distinguishing Legitimate, Superficial, and Fabricated Anti-corruption Campaigns

Under this two-year activity with Internews and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), DevLab@Penn is developing a system to detect reporting on anti-corruption campaigns and classify them as Legitimate, Superficial, and Fabricated. Specifically, we will draw on the Machine Learning for Peace project's infrastructure, which scrapes articles from more than 350 high-quality domestic media outlets based across 60 countries and uses large language models to detect reporting on corruption-related legal measures (including arrest, legal actions, purges, and raids). Under this project, DevLab will identify anti-corruption campaigns by detecting large increases in reporting on corruption-related legal measures. DevLab will then measure the extent to which legal measures indicate genuine or politically-motivated campaigns. 


### Uganda Strategic Communication Utilization and Learning Activity 

Under this activity with USAID and Social Impact, we are designing and experimentally testing the impact of pro-democracy narratives on the attitudes and behavior of citizens in Uganda. Using survey and lab-in-the field experiments, we test the efficacy of different messages in increasing support for democratic institutions and increasing civic participation.
