\textbf{\large Selected External Awards \& Grants}\\
\rule[3mm]{\textwidth}{.2pt}
My research has been supported by the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and National Science Foundation and multiple private foundations. Since 2022, I have been a principal investigator on nearly \$3.5 million in awards, carrying projects from conceptualization and proposal through design, implementation, and the dissemination of results to the scientific and policy communities. My most recent awards include:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -5pt
  \item \$1.6m Department of Defense \href{https://minerva.defense.gov/Research/Funded-Projects/Article/3956358/modeling-climate-induced-societal-adaptation-and-population/}{Minerva Research Initiative} grant to support interdisciplinary research with Environmental Sciences faculty to model the impact of climate change on adaptation, conflict, and migration.
  \item \$900,000 Agency for International Development grant to develop large-scale webscraping and machine learning text classification pipeline tracking and forecasting foreign influence operations and political instability in aid-receiving countries
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\large Invited Public Speaking}\\
\rule[3mm]{\textwidth}{.2pt}
I am passionate about communicating research findings for non-technical audiences to inform decision-making. My recent public speaking invitations include:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -5pt
  \item U.S. Department of State (Washington, D.C.): I presented results from a commissioned trial applying novel data produced by my research team to forecast political instability. The focus was on how forecasts should inform DoS budget and operations planning.
  \item Perry World House (Philadelphia): I discussed how my research can shape decision-makers' understanding of Russia's foreign policy and influence operations in developing countries.
  \item Leibniz Center for Informatics (Germany): I discussed the use of ML/AI to extract information from highly-multilingual text for a continuous, large-scale data production operation.
  \item U.S. Army (Fort Liberty), UN Data Strategy Community (remote), Vienna University of Economics and Business (Austria): I introduced public-facing data products developed by my team to track political events and forecast instability in emerging markets. Discussion focused on the use of event tracking and forecast data dashboards for decision-making.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\large Academic Manuscripts Under Review}\\
\rule[3mm]{\textwidth}{.2pt}
I have six academic manuscripts currently under review (including revise \& resubmit) at academic journals. The projects use causal inference and ML tools applied to spatial, network, financial, and text data. Specific topics include an RCT to expand youth social networks and civic engagement in Ethiopia, experimental research on organization decision-making in autocracies, and the strategic logic of Russian influence operations.
