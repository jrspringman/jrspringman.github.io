I am an applied researcher working to design, implement, and evaluate data-driven solutions to complex problems. I have deep experience managing highly interdisciplinary research teams, establishing long-term collaborations with public and private sector partners, and communicating technical material to policy audiences. I have six years of experience managing a team of 12 researchers and staff in a lab environment and 10 years of experience with causal inference and machine learning research tools. Since 2022, I have been awarded nearly \$3.5 million as a principal investigator on both federal and private research grants.
