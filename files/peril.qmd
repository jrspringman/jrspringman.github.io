<!-- https://american.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/AU/job/Spring-Valley-Campus-Washington-DC/Research-Assistant-Professor---Executive-Director-of-PERIL_R2285 -->


As an applied researcher with deep experience designing, testing, and deploying evidence-based solutions to complex social problems, I am an ideal candidate to serve as Executive Director of the Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab. I possess the necessary expertise managing a social science research lab, including large-scale RCT-evaluations and long-term data collection projects using webscraping and cutting-edge AI, establishing long-term collaborations with civil society organizations, communicating technical material to policy audiences and integrating research and practice, securing funding from federal and private donors, and researching polarization and extremism across diverse and challenging contexts. 

Currently, I serve as Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Director of Civic Research for PDRI-DevLab. Since moving to UPenn in 2022, my has research received nearly $3.5 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and Open Society Foundations. 

I am a co-PI on long-term projects leveraging recent advances in big data and machine learning to track foreign influence, forecast repression and social conflict and maintain a public-facing early warning system, and model how climate factors affect environmental conflict, teach a course on data science for global development, and independently manage several federally funded projects. 



I would be honored to serve PERIL’s mission of reducing extremist violence. I am deeply alarmed by the rise of political extremism in the United States and around the world, and I am eager to employ my comparative background conducting field-based projects in polarized, conflict-affected countries including Serbia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Ghana, and Cambodia. 


## Management

On the [Machine Learning for Peace](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/civic-space-data-and-forecasts/) project, I manage a team of three full-time data scientists, five pre-doctoral fellows, multiple PhD students and affiliated faculty, and ten undergraduates.


I have produced reports and given invited talks for academic and policy audiences ranging from the Leibniz Center for Informatics to the UN Data Strategy Community and the U.S. Army Special Forces at Fort Liberty. 


- Managing a team of data scientists, post-doctoral researchers, I used this data to publish more than a dozen policy reports, develop six public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time, and attracted 1,200 unique users from 73 countries to our online forecasting system over a 12 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports.

## Civil societty
Working closely with civil society organizations. Deep collaboration with civil society organizations
- Ethiopia: co-design of Tolerant Engagement Forums intervention 
- Cambodia: first RCT evaluation of an NGO capacity-building intervention 
- [Machine Learning for Peace](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/civic-space-data-and-forecasts/): long-term collaboration to develop actionable data and forecasts of political crises.


## Substance
At DevLab, my research has focused on helping policymakers, donors, and NGOs strengthen citizen engagement and civil society to build community resilience.

While my research has focused on a range of topics related to civil society and , I have significant substantive background on issues related to building resilience to polarization, misinformation, and extremist violence
- Ethiopia [RCT evaluation](https://jrspringman.github.io/files/ethiopia_ie.pdf)
- Ghana [policy report](https://jrspringman.github.io/files/USAID_Ghana_MEL_Radio%20and%20Social%20Media%20Assessment_%20Report_Oct1-2023.pdf) on survey experiment of 200 radio station managers on the threat of misinformation and 

## Experience
My past experience lends itself to developing and testing interventions aimed at preventing radicalization and violent extremism in several ways. 
- online survey experiments can be useful for interventions aimed at online content
- field-based interventions in conflict settings can help with offline content
- worked with international and local NGOs on long-term collaborations to design and test interventions and validate measures of important outcomes
- extremely successful at raising funds for applied research from federal and private donors
- innovative approaches to measurement that include SOTA language models
- managing extensive research staff including data scientists, postdocs, and undergraduates

## Job info

Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab (PERIL)
- preventing radicalization to violent extremism by strengthening community resilience
- public health approach to design, test, and scale-up evidence-based tools and strategies that effectively reduce the threat of radicalization to harmful online and offline content including conspiracy theories, mis/disinformation, propaganda, and supremacist ideologies

## Fundraising and Communication 

 Winning extremely competitive federal grants required me to design high-impact research and communicate the design and results to both technical and non-technical audiences. This included regular presentations to non-technical policy audiences. I further developed these skills teaching [my undergraduate course](https://jrspringman.github.io/psci3200-globaldev/) introducing global development students to causal inference and data science tools and techniques.

Despite the challenges of ongoing civil conflict and the onset of COVID-19




In my role as Research Professor, I design and implement research to tackle complex measurement and inference challenges and generate actionable insights for policymakers. As Executive Director at Peril, I hope to build-on 


My background in measurement and metrics design equips me to conduct research to understand the behaviors of Google's end users. As a Research Professor, I lead a high-profile project that developed a large, highly multilingual media corpus and pioneered the use of large language models (LLMs) in social science research to generate novel data tracking the cross-national incidence of important political events. I further leveraged this data to answer pressing policy questions and develop solutions, including public-facing event monitoring and forecasting systems. 

<!-- I also have deep experience in randomized experiments and causal analyses, including advanced survey experimental research, large-scale randomized control trials in difficult implementation environments including ongoing civil conflict, and spatial approaches to estimating causal effects with observational panel data.  -->

<!-- This deep background in experimental research, cutting-edge natural language processing, and the translation of complex findings into actionable insights aligns with PERIL’s efforts to bring scientific excellence and statistical methods to the challenges of product creation.  -->

<!-- My academic position has given me years of experience working closely with policymakers to generate and communicate tailored evidence to inform important policy decisions.   -->

<!-- This has included broad evidence on how aid-implementation through non-profits impacts political credit as well as narrow evidence on the effectiveness of specific interventions.  -->



<!-- My research uses machine learning techniques including forecasting and large language models and causal inference tools including field and survey experiments.  -->
<!-- I am particularly interested in developing novel design and measurement strategies to generate rigorous evidence from projects with limited budgets and challenging implementation environments. -->
