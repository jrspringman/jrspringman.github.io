As an an applied researcher leading large-scale, federally funded projects, I have spent the last decade embedding with policymakers and stakeholders to identify challenges, design solutions, and understand their impact. Among my government clients, I cultivated a reputation for quickly grasping the most critical problems in diverse policy domains and proposing creative solutions. In the 5 years after finishing my PhD, I was commissioned by USAID to lead 12 projects on a wide range of topics in foreign aid and national security, securing repeated engagements by multiple teams. This experience gives me unique insights into how new frontiers in data and technology can significantly improve performance for McKinsey's clients. 

Since 2022, I have been awarded \$3.5 million as a principal investigator on both federal and private research grants, carrying projects from conceptualization and proposal through design, implementation, and the dissemination of results. My work has used cutting-edge methods to shape decision making, from pioneering the use of AI to build data pipelines forecasting geopolitical risk to using randomized control trials to evaluate major policy interventions. I am passionate about translating technical research into action, and have given invited talks to hundreds of policymakers across more than a dozen agencies in five countries. From policy officials at the U.S. Department of State to civil society stakeholders across emerging markets, I have built a track record of translating complex analyses into actionable strategic recommendations. 

As a post-doctoral researcher at Duke in 2019, I co-founded a high-profile project building a public-facing early warning system forecasting political instability in emerging markets. Managing a team of data scientists and PhD students, I led the construction of a research infrastructure to continually update a large, highly multilingual corpus of high-quality media and use deep learning translation models and fine-tuned transformers to extract information from text. This project's funding was renewed over seven years and attracted more than \$6 million in support from the U.S. Department of Defense (including a Minerva Grant awarded to fewer than 10 teams per year), Agency for International Development, and private donors.

My lab used data from this project to publish more than a dozen commissioned policy reports, develop public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time by decision-makers, and attracted 1,200 unique users from 70 countries over a 10 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports. The success of this project led to my promotion to Research Assistant Professor at UPenn, where I manage three full-time data scientists, five pre-doctoral fellows, multiple affiliated faculty and PhD students, and a large pool of undergraduates. 

I also have deep experience leading randomized experiments commissioned by stakeholders. As a Senior Research Associate, I led an evaluation that provided rigorous evidence that a U.S. government foreign aid program was failing to accomplish it's goals, resulting in the program's cancellation and a more effective use of government resources. In another project, I worked with policymakers at USAID to design survey experiments to understand the strategic behavior of non-profits receiving U.S. support in highly repressive countries. Based on the findings, I produced a policy brief recommending changes to how the agency supports local partners in repressive countries and presented the recommendations to high-level officials. A third project used insights from behavioral psychology and economics to design and evaluate an intervention to increase civic engagement among youth in highly polarized countries by more than 40%. This resulted in a highly effective intervention that my partners are seeking to scale across developing countries.

As an applied researcher, I have been extremely successful at winning highly competitive research grants. However, recent terminations of major federal research initiatives have cut-off opportunities for high-impact collaboration with U.S. government agencies. I am now looking to transfer my skills to the private sector. I excel at immersing myself in new environments and identifying creative solutions to persistent problems. At McKinsey, I would quickly gain exposure to the challenges faced by leaders across a wide range of sectors and industries.



<!-- Deep experience leading large-scale research projects, including managing large teams of researchers, working with clients to design research that can inform decision-making, coordinating multiple stakeholders across countries and languages, and executing complicated research designs in highly challenging settings. -->

<!-- Working at a university has also given the opportunity to teach and mentor students at the undergraduate and graduate level. My academic career has taught me the importance of mentorship, and I plan to continue fostering data science best practices by guiding junior colleagues and building a collaborative culture that values creativity and rigor.  -->


<!-- Furthermore, my international experience makes me well prepared to work with companies facing that emerging markets. -->

<!-- Over the past six years, I have managed and mentored an interdisciplinary team of twelve researchers and data scientists. Under my leadership, this team has planned and executed many large-scale projects, ensuring that the findings are both rigorous and actionable.  -->


<!-- My most recent awards include a $1.6m Department of Defense [Minerva Research Initiative](https://minerva.defense.gov/Research/Funded-Projects/Article/3956358/modeling-climate-induced-societal-adaptation-and-population/) grant to support interdisciplinary research with Environmental Sciences faculty to model the impact of climate change on adaptation, conflict, and migration and a \$900,000 Agency for International Development grant to maintain and expand a large-scale webscraping and machine learning text classification pipeline to monitor and forecast political instability in more than 60 countries. -->
