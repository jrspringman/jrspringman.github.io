As an applied researcher passionate about using rigorous analytics to inform high-stakes decisions, I am eager to help Applecart's clients reach and influence decision makers as Director of Analytics & Survey Science. I have valuable expertise working with policymakers to identify high-impact research questions, designing research to provide rigorous answers, securing funding, communicating the findings to decision-makers, and thinking through the implications for policy and strategy.

I have six years of experience managing a team of data scientists using predictive modeling to inform programming decisions by U.S. government agencies. I am passionate about communicating evidence, and have given invited talks to hundreds of policymakers across more than a dozen agencies in five countries. I also have 10 years of experience with survey research and statistical computing tools -- including R, Python, git, markdown, and shiny -- and strong knowledge of research design, network analysis, and machine learning. This includes a deep familiarity with randomized experiments (including conjoints and RCTs), observational causal inference (including difference-in-differences and synthetic control), and machine learning (including LLMs and forecasting).

As a post-doctoral research associate, I co-founded a high-profile project leveraging recent advances in big data and machine learning to forecast political instability in emerging markets for a public-facing early warning system. Managing a team of data scientists and PhD students, I led the construction a research infrastructure to continually update a large, highly multilingual media corpus and use fine-tuned transformer models to extract information from text. My lab used this data to publish more than a dozen commissioned policy reports, develop six public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time by decision makers, and attracted 1,200 unique users from 73 countries over a 10 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports.

The success of this project led to my promotion to Research Assistant Professor at UPenn, where I manage three full-time data scientists, five pre-doctoral fellows, multiple affiliated faculty and PhD students, and a large pool of undergraduates. Since moving to UPenn in 2022, my research has received nearly $3.5 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and private foundations. 

I have conducted applied research that directly informed policy decisions. Working with the US Mission to Cambodia, I designed an RCT evaluation of a major program to improve the financial capacity of small firms and non-profits working as U.S. government partners. The evaluation provided rigorous evidence that the program was failing to accomplish it's goals and resulted in program's cancellation and a more effective use of US government funds. In another project, I worked with the Agency for International Development to design a conjoint survey experiment answering important questions about the strategic behavior of non-profits receiving U.S. support to work in highly repressive countries. The findings informed the agency's approach to soliciting grant proposals from local partners.

My academic position has given me years of experience working closely with government officials and other decision makers to generate and communicate tailored evidence to inform high-stakes decisions. However, I'm excited to deploy these skills in the technology sector, where analytics can inform decisions at an even faster pace. 



<!-- During this period, I have worked closely with civil society organizations on both digital and field-based projects. This included identifying and recruiting partners in Ethiopian civil society to co-design and rigorously evaluate an intervention to increase civic engagement and social cohesion in highly polarized settings. This resulted in a highly effective [intervention](https://jrspringman.github.io/files/ethiopia_ie.pdf) that we are seeking to scale across the country. In Cambodia, I led the first RCT evaluation of an NGO capacity-building intervention, working with more than 100 CSOs over a three year period. -->



<!-- As a Research Professor, I lead a high-profile project that developed a large, highly multilingual media corpus and pioneered the use of large language models (LLMs) in social science research to generate novel data tracking the cross-national incidence of important political events. I further leveraged this data to answer pressing policy questions and develop solutions, including public-facing event monitoring and forecasting systems.  -->

<!-- I also have deep experience in randomized experiments and causal analyses, including advanced survey experimental research, large-scale randomized control trials in difficult implementation environments including ongoing civil conflict, and spatial approaches to estimating causal effects with observational panel data.  -->

<!-- This deep background in experimental research, cutting-edge natural language processing, and the translation of complex findings into actionable insights aligns with PERILâ€™s efforts to bring scientific excellence and statistical methods to the challenges of product creation.  -->

<!-- My academic position has given me years of experience working closely with policymakers to generate and communicate tailored evidence to inform important policy decisions.   -->

<!-- This has included broad evidence on how aid-implementation through non-profits impacts political credit as well as narrow evidence on the effectiveness of specific interventions.  -->
