I am a concerned scientist displaced by recent terminations to awarded grants! 

As a Research Assistant Professor in a social science research lab, my researched focused on generating insights to help donors and civil society strengthen democratic institutions in developing countries. Given the threats facing U.S. democracy, I am eager to work with an organization encouraging pluralism and democratic engagement at home.

I have been extremely successful at winning highly competitive research grants from both federal and private donors. However, in February, terminations cancelled more than $2.5 million in committed federal funding for my projects, including a prestigious [Minerva grant](https://www.science.org/content/article/pentagon-guts-national-security-program-harnessed-social-science) funding interdisciplinary research involving political and climate scientists to model the impact of climate change on adaptation, conflict, and migration. I am now looking for my next opportunity.

At PDRI-DevLab, I have managed multiple externally funded projects, carrying them from conceptualization through design, implementation, evaluation, and the dissemination of results to the scientific and policy communities. I currently manage a team of three full-time data scientists and engineers, six predoctoral fellows, one PhD student, and a large pool of undergraduate research assistants. I have experience establishing long-term collaborations with public and private sector partners, communicating technical material to policy audiences, and evaluating behavioral interventions across diverse subject-matters and contexts.

I believe that my skills experience makes me an ideal candidate to serve as the Research Director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. I have an established track record of forging long-term collaborations with public and private sector partners, communicating technical material to policy audiences, and generating research products designed for public consumption. I am passionate about defending science and the democratic institutions and values it relies on.
