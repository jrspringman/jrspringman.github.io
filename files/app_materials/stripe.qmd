As an applied quantitative social scientist leading large-scale, federally funded data projects, I have spent the last decade working across disciplines to design and deliver innovative solutions to complex problems. In my current role as Director of Research and Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, I lead end-to-end projects that leverage machine learning, advanced analytics, and scalable data infrastructure to generate insights and guide strategic decision-making for high-level public sector clients.

I have led over a dozen complex analytics initiatives commissioned by U.S. federal agencies, often embedding directly with stakeholders to align on goals and deliver measurable impact. My technical background includes designing and managing data pipelines, conducting large-scale multilingual surveys, designing and running randomized experiments, building interactive data dashboards, and applying natural language processing and forecasting methods to real-world challenges. 

Over the past six years, I’ve managed a twelve-person interdisciplinary team of researchers and data scientists. Together, we’ve developed and deployed high-impact data products, ensuring high data quality, clear documentation, and strategic alignment with stakeholder needs. Since 2022, I’ve served as principal investigator on over $3.5 million in federal and private research grants. Our work has included fielding and analyzing 14 surveys in 10 languages, building machine learning pipelines for automated information extraction, and creating tools and reports that directly inform policy.

A core focus of my work has been building public-facing data tools using machine learning. I co-founded a high-profile project to build a public-facing early warning system forecasting political instability in emerging markets. Managing a team of data scientists and PhD students, I led the construction of a research infrastructure to continually update a large, highly multilingual corpus of high-quality media and use deep learning translation models and fine-tuned transformers and LLMs to extract information from text. This project's funding was renewed over six years and attracted support from the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and private donors. Under my leadership, my team developed public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time by high-level decision-makers and attracted users from 70 countries over a 10 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports. 

I bring to Stripe deep technical experience, a track record of cross-functional collaboration, and a strong ability to translate complex analytics into actionable business strategy. My projects have consistently demonstrated my ability to design scalable, reliable systems that generate insights for internal teams and external stakeholders alike. I am excited about Stripe’s mission to expand the GDP of the internet, and I would welcome the opportunity to apply my experience with data pipelines, modeling, and communication to support Stripe’s products and users at scale.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Stripe’s data science work.
