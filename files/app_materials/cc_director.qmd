As an international relations scholar with deep experience leading large-scale research projects on both U.S. foreign challenges and conflict and polarization in conflict-affected countries, I am an ideal candidate to be the Carnegie Corporation's Program Director for Peace and Security. I have expertise managing large research grants from conceptualization and proposal through analysis and the dissemination of results. As an academic working closely with policymakers and a wide range of implementing partners, I have developed the necessary subject-matter knowledge, technical skills, and leadership experience to develop and implement the International Program's new strategy around international peace and security, regional challenges, and American foreign policy.

Currently, I serve as Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Since moving to Penn in 2022, I have been awarded nearly $3.5 million as a principal investigator on both federal and private research grants. This includes the [Machine Learning for Peace](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/civic-space-data-and-forecasts/csews/) project, which uses recent advances in machine learning to track and forecast political instability, conflict, and foreign influence by Russia and China across the developing world. Using the data generated by this project, I have co-authored more than a dozen commissioned policy reports, developed public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time, and attracted 1,200 unique users from 73 countries to our online forecasting system over a 12 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports. This project's funding was renewed over six years and attracted support from the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and private donors.

I have been extremely successful at winning highly competitive research grants. However, in February, terminations cancelled more than $2.5 million in committed federal funding for my projects, including a prestigious Department of Defense [Minerva grant](https://www.science.org/content/article/pentagon-guts-national-security-program-harnessed-social-science) funding interdisciplinary research involving political and climate scientists to model the impact of climate change on adaptation, conflict, and migration. I am now looking for my next opportunity. At Carnegie, I would be excited to facilitate high-impact research through grantmaking and engagement with grantees.

I have six years of management experience in a social science research lab. I lead a team of three full-time data scientists, five pre-doctoral fellows, multiple affiliated faculty and PhD students, and a large pool of undergraduates. During this period, I have coordinated long-term collaborations with multiple government agencies, universities, and civil society organizations in the United States, Ethiopia, Uganda, Serbia, and Cambodia. I am also passionate about communicating evidence, and have given invited talks to hundreds of policymakers and stakeholders across more than a dozen agencies in five countries. 

My research has directly informed policy decisions. Working with the US Mission to Cambodia, I designed an RCT evaluation of a major program to improve the financial capacity of non-profits working as U.S. government partners. The evaluation provided rigorous evidence that the program was failing to accomplish it's goals and resulted in program's cancellation. To my knowledge, this was the first RCT evaluation of an NGO capacity-building intervention, working with more than 100 CSOs over a three year period. 

In another project, I worked with policymakers at the U.S. Agency for International Development to design a conjoint survey experiment that answered pressing questions about the strategic behavior of non-profits receiving U.S. support in highly repressive countries. Based on the findings, I produced a policy brief recommending changes to how the agency supports local partners in repressive countries and presented the recommendations to high-level officials. In Ethiopia, I identified and recruited partners in Ethiopian civil society to co-design and rigorously evaluate an intervention to increase civic engagement and social cohesion in highly polarized settings. This [project](https://jrspringman.github.io/files/ethiopia_ie.pdf) resulted in a highly effective intervention that our partners are working to scale across the country. 

I have deep respect for the work being done by the Carnegie Corporation to support research on international relations, democracy, and peace. I believe that my commitment to applied, policy-relevant research, combined with my technical background in applying cutting-edge methods, including the application of randomized control trials and machine learning approaches to the study of conflict, political instability, and foreign policy, will bring a unique set of skills to Carnegie's grantmaking. I have dedicated my career to building practical understanding of these topics and it would be an honor to join Carnegie in doing this work.
