As an applied quantitative social scientist leading large-scale, federally funded projects, I have spent the last decade embedding with clients and stakeholders to understand challenges, design innovative solutions, and deliver measurable impact. In my current role as Director of Research and Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, I oversee end-to-end research processes that use advanced causal inference and machine learning to generate insights, develop tools, and guide decision-making for high-level public sector clients.

I’ve led over a dozen complex research projects commissioned by U.S. federal agencies, often working across disciplines to design and deliver analytics that are both rigorous and actionable. 
My technical experience includes building and managing data pipelines, conducting large-scale surveys and survey experiments, implementing experimental designs, and applying forecasting and natural language processing methods to real-world challenges. 

Over the past six years, I’ve managed an interdisciplinary team of twelve researchers and data scientists. Under my leadership, we have executed numerous projects from design through deployment, ensuring high-quality data and strategic alignment with stakeholder goals. Since 2022, I have served as principal investigator on federal and private research grants totaling nearly $3.5 million. My team’s work has included fielding and analyzing 14 surveys in 10 languages, developing machine learning pipelines, and guiding policy through evidence-based insights.

My research has directly shaped U.S. policy. At Duke University, I led a randomized evaluation that revealed the ineffectiveness of a major foreign aid initiative, leading to its cancellation. In another engagement, I partnered with U.S. officials to design a conjoint survey to address nonprofit behavior in emerging markets—producing recommendations that were adopted to improve funding strategies. In a third project, we designed and evaluated a civic engagement intervention informed by behavioral economics, which is now being scaled internationally.

I also have extensive background in machine learning research. I co-founded a high-profile project to build a public-facing early warning system forecasting political instability in emerging markets. Managing a team of data scientists and PhD students, I led the construction of a research infrastructure to continually update a large, highly multilingual corpus of high-quality media and use deep learning translation models and fine-tuned transformers and LLMs to extract information from text. This project's funding was renewed over six years and attracted support from the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and private donors. Under my leadership, my team developed public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time by high-level decision-makers and attracted users from 70 countries over a 10 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports. 

My experience aligns closely with CapTech’s mission of empowering clients through data, technology, and strategic leadership. I bring deep expertise in managing diverse teams, implementing scalable solutions, and translating technical insights into action. I’ve worked in fast-paced, multi-stakeholder environments and pride myself on clear, client-focused communication.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to CapTech’s industry-leading work in data and analytics.
