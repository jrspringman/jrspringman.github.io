I am an applied researcher passionate about delivering innovative quantitative user research to inform real-world decision-making. As a Director of Research at PDRI-DevLab and Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, I have spent the last decade using causal inference and machine learning to inform high-stakes decision-making by policymakers in the U.S. government. After successfully leading more than a dozen large-scale research projects commissioned by federal agencies on topics ranging from planning around geopolitical risks to the optimal design of awards and contracts, I am eager to apply my skills in an industry setting.

By working with large teams of collaborators and stakeholders to deliver rigorous, data-driven insights that inform strategic decisions, I have cultivated the skills and experience required to work closely with Adobe's Design Research & Strategy team. I have 12 years of experience conducting background research and interviews, identifying and recruiting research participants from unique, targeted samples, and synthesizing insights to inform the design of policies and presenting the results to stakeholders.

Over the past six years, I have managed and mentored an interdisciplinary team of twelve researchers and data scientists. Under my leadership, this team has planned and executed many large-scale projects, ensuring that the findings are both rigorous and actionable. Since 2022, I have been awarded nearly \$3.5 million as a principal investigator on both federal and private research grants, carrying projects from conceptualization and proposal through design, implementation, and the dissemination of results to the scientific and policy communities. 

My research has directly informed policy. As a research associate at Duke University, I led a randomized evaluation that provided rigorous evidence that a U.S. government foreign aid program was failing to accomplish it's goals, resulting in the program's cancellation. In another project, I worked with policymakers to design a conjoint survey experiment that answered pressing questions about the strategic behavior of non-profits receiving U.S. support in emerging markets. I proposed changes to how the agency supports local partners that were implemented. A third project used insights from behavioral psychology and economics to design and evaluate an intervention to increase civic engagement and social cohesion among youth in highly polarized countries. This resulted in a highly effective intervention that my partners are seeking to scale across developing countries.

I also have extensive background in machine learning research. I co-founded a high-profile project to build a public-facing early warning system forecasting political instability in emerging markets. Managing a team of data scientists and PhD students, I led the construction of a research infrastructure to continually update a large, highly multilingual corpus of high-quality media and use deep learning translation models and fine-tuned transformers and LLMs to extract information from text. This project's funding was renewed over six years and attracted support from the U.S. Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and private donors. Under my leadership, my team developed public-facing data dashboards averaging 150 hours of monthly active usage time by high-level decision-makers and attracted users from 70 countries over a 10 month period, with more than 800 policymakers signing up to receive our monthly reports. 

My experience working closely with policymakers and stakeholders prepares me to collaborate with Netflix's product managers and design team to identify challenges, design solutions, and measure their impact. I am passionate about translating scientific research into action, and have given invited talks to hundreds of policymakers across more than a dozen agencies in five countries. I specialize in communicating technical material to non-technical audiences: from policy officials at the U.S. Department of State to civil society stakeholders across emerging markets, I have built a track record of translating complex analyses into clear, strategic recommendations.
