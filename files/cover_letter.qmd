As a longtime Redditor and a researcher with a strong background in experimental and computational research, I would be eager to contribute to Reddit’s mission of connecting communities and advancing the impact of its advertising platform. In my role as Research Professor at UPenn, I design and implement research to tackle complex measurement and inference challenges and generate actionable insights for policymakers. As Senior Measurement Researcher, I hope to use my passion for developing novel approaches to measure attitudinal and behavioral outcomes across cultures and languages, while doing so in an industry setting where evidence can quickly be used for real-world impact.

I have deep experience in experimental and quasi-experimental research, including advanced survey experimental designs, large-scale randomized control trials in difficult implementation environments including ongoing civil conflict, and spatial approaches to estimating causal effects with observational panel data. I also co-lead a long-term, high-profile project that pioneered the use of large language models (LLMs) in social science research, fine-tuning open-source LLMs to execute sophisticated text classification tasks on a large, original, highly multilingual corpus. Managing a team of data scientists, post-doctoral fellows, and research associates, I have lead the production of novel data tracking the cross-national incidence of important political events, more than a dozen commissioned policy reports leveraging this data to answer pressing policy questions, and developed solutions, including public-facing event monitoring and forecasting systems. Since moving to UPenn in 2022, my research has received nearly $3.5 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, Department of State, Agency for International Development, and private foundations.

I am proficient in R, including experience with package development and interactive data visualization, and manage teams using Python and NoSQL to organize and maintain original big data corpora. I have produced reports and given invited talks for academic and policy audiences ranging from the Leibniz Center for Informatics to the UN Data Strategy Community and the U.S. Army Special Forces at Fort Liberty. Teaching causal inference methods to students in my data science course at UPenn has further strengthened my ability to communicate effectively on these technical issues. This deep background in experimental research, cutting-edge natural language processing, bespoke sentiment analysis, and the translation of complex findings into actionable insights aligns with Reddit’s need for a technically savvy researcher who can develop and refine measurement methodologies that amplify the platform’s value to advertisers. 

While I enjoy my academic position tremendously, much of what I love most about the research process would be more valuable in an industry setting. My academic position has given me years of experience working closely with policymakers to generate and communicate tailored evidence to inform important policy decisions. However, as an outside researcher, my ability to push for evidence-based policy change or the adoption of new measurement approaches within relevant government agencies has been limited. At Reddit, I hope to develop new methodologies and insights that are rapidly converted into actions that benefit both Reddit and its advertisers. I am also drawn to this role’s opportunity to influence the broader research and analytics industry through thought leadership. 

As evidence mounts that social media ecosystems are fracturing, Reddit’s commitment to fostering authentic conversations and its unique role as a community-driven platform make it a critical online space that I would be honored to contribute to.
