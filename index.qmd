<p>I am a Research Scientist on the Demography and Survey Science (DSS) team at Meta. With DSS, I conduct research on artificial intelligence, including the use and perceptions of AI tools within the tech industry and by citizen.

<p>Before joining Meta, I was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn, I worked in <a href="https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDRI-DevLab</a> and served as PI or co-PI on several large projects, including the <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zp3sr_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning for Peace</a> project and the Modeling Climate-Induced Societal Adaptation and Population Displacement with New Machine-Coded Environmental Event Data project.</p>

<p>As an academic, I studied political economy in developing countries, with a specific interest in how non-profit organizations shape, and are shaped by, politics and governance. My research generated insights that helped donors and civil society strengthen democratic institutions in developing countries. To investigate these topics, my research used spatial analysis, machine learning techniques, and causal inference tools including field and survey experiments.</p>
<p>My research has been published in <em>International Organization</em>, <em>World Politics</em>, <em>Political Science Research and Methods</em>, and <em>International Studies Quarterly,</em> and I have produced commissioned policy reports for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Center for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance; the Innovation, Technology, and Research Hub; the Analytic Task on Authoritarian Resurgence and Influence; the Bureau for Policy, Planning and Learning; and the Missions to Ethiopia, Cambodia, Ghana, and Zimbabwe. My work has received support from the US Department of Defense, USAID, the Open Society Foundations, the National Science Foundation, an anonymous philanthropic foundation, and the American Political Science Association.</p>
<p>While at Penn, I taught Global Development: Intermediate Topics in Politics, Policy, and Data. This course provided an introduction to data analysis methods, inferential techniques, and computational tools in the context of contemporary development research. Materials for the course and source code are available on the <a href="https://jrspringman.github.io/psci3200-globaldev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">course website</a>.</p>
<p>I completed my PhD in comparative politics and international relations at the <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/polisci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Pennsylvania</a> in 2019. From 2019 - 2022, I was a Postdoc and then Senior Research Associate at Duke University.</p>
